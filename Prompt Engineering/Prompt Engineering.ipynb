This means if you are a citizen of both countries, you won't be taxed twice on the same income. This could potentially save you money. However, the specifics of how you can benefit financially from this agreement would depend on your personal financial situation and tax obligations in both countries. It is recommended to consult with a tax advisor or legal expert who understands the tax laws of both South Africa and Cyprus to get detailed advice tailored to your situation. \n",
